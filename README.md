# Duologue for Cyberpunk 2077 (ReShade)

**Duologue** is a single lightweight ReShade shader designed to work **with** Cyberpunk 2077's native ray tracing rather than replacing it.  
It combines **adaptive exposure**, **filmic tonemapping**, **micro-contrast shaping**, and **shadow/highlight control** into one pass, leaving other shaders for final polish.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Features
- Adaptive exposure targeting mid-gray
- ACES or Hable filmic curve option
- Micro-contrast for added depth without over-sharpening
- Shadow lift and highlight roll-off to preserve detail in RT reflections
- Designed to slot between RTGI and finishing filters

---

## ðŸ“‚ Installation
1. Install [ReShade](https://reshade.me) for Cyberpunk 2077 (DirectX 10/11/12 mode).

2. `Duologue`  
3. `qUINT_Lightroom`  
4. `PD80_04_Contrast_Brightness_Saturation`  
5. `Technicolor2`  
6. `Deband`  
7. `Clarity`

## ðŸŽ› Controls
- **DUO_Strength** â€“ Overall effect strength
- **DUO_TargetGray** â€“ Target mid-gray luminance
- **DUO_MinEV / DUO_MaxEV** â€“ Exposure range limits
- **DUO_Contrast** â€“ Micro-contrast amount
- **DUO_ShadowLift** â€“ Lifts shadow detail
- **DUO_HighlightRoll** â€“ Rolls off highlight clipping
- **DUO_UseACES** â€“ Toggle ACES or Hable filmic curve

---

## ðŸ“Œ Tips
- Keep **RTGI** strength moderate to avoid double-lighting (game already has RTGI).
- Use **Lightroom** for fine tint/temperature adjustments after Duologue.
- Keep sharpening subtle; Duologue already boosts local contrast.
